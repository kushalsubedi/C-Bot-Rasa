# ü™ê Weasel Project: Demo replacing an NER component in a pretrained pipeline

A minimal demo NER project that replaces the NER component in an existing pretrained pipeline. All other pipeline components are preserved and frozen during training.

## üìã project.yml

The [`project.yml`](project.yml) defines the data assets required by the
project, as well as the available commands and workflows. For details, see the
[Weasel documentation](https://github.com/explosion/weasel).

### ‚èØ Commands

The following commands are defined by the project. They
can be executed using [`weasel run [name]`](https://github.com/explosion/weasel/tree/main/docs/cli.md#rocket-run).
Commands are only re-run if their inputs have changed.

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `download` | Download the pretrained pipeline |
| `convert` | Convert the data to spaCy's binary format |
| `create-config` | Create a config for replacing only NER from an existing pipeline |
| `train` | Train the NER model |
| `evaluate` | Evaluate the model and export metrics |
| `package` | Package the trained model as a pip package |
| `visualize-model` | Visualize the model's output interactively using Streamlit |

### ‚è≠ Workflows

The following workflows are defined by the project. They
can be executed using [`weasel run [name]`](https://github.com/explosion/weasel/tree/main/docs/cli.md#rocket-run)
and will run the specified commands in order. Commands are only re-run if their
inputs have changed.

| Workflow | Steps |
| --- | --- |
| `all` | `convert` &rarr; `create-config` &rarr; `train` &rarr; `evaluate` |

### üóÇ Assets

The following assets are defined by the project. They can
be fetched by running [`weasel assets`](https://github.com/explosion/weasel/tree/main/docs/cli.md#open_file_folder-assets)
in the project directory.

| File | Source | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`assets/train.json`](assets/train.json) | Local | Demo training data converted from the v2 example scripts with `srsly.write_json("train.json", TRAIN_DATA)` |
| [`assets/dev.json`](assets/dev.json) | Local | Demo development data |
